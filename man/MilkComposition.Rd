\description{
Data from Aitchison on compositional data analysis.
In an attempt to improve the quality of cowâ€™s milk, milk from each of thirty cows was assessed by dietary composition before and after a strictly controlled dietary and hormonal regime over a period of eight weeks. Although seasonal variations in milk quality could probably be regarded as negligible over this period a control group of thirty cows was kept under the same conditions but on the standard regime. The sixty cows were of course allocated to control and treatment groups at random. Note that the available data are incomplete and only 24 of the cows in the after group are available.
Unfortunately the individual level data were not complete so we also have perturbation data for the analysis.
